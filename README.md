# Analyzing-Customer-Feedback-From-Surveys-PYTHON-AUTOMATION-PROJECT

In this project, I used Python functions and loops to analyze customer feedback data and answer practical business questions that teams deal with every day.

I approached this as if I were supporting a customer experience or operations team that needs quick, repeatable insights from raw feedback data.

What I did and why:

1️⃣ Categorized customer ratings (1–10 scale)

I built a function to automatically classify ratings as negative, neutral, or positive.

➡️ Why: This helps companies quickly measure customer sentiment instead of reading feedback one by one.

2️⃣ Tested the logic on small, medium, and large datasets

I ran the function on datasets ranging from 10 to 10,000 ratings.

➡️ Why: Testing at different scales ensures the logic works reliably as data grows.

3️⃣ Identified unverified customer feedback

I created a validation function to calculate how many feedback IDs were not from verified customers and what percentage they represent.

➡️ Why: This helps teams assess data quality and trust the insights they’re using.

4️⃣ Analyzed customer spending behavior

I wrote a function to count how many customers spent $100 or more based on purchase data.

➡️ Why: This helps identify high-value customers and supports targeting or retention strategies.

Key takeaway:

Python automation allows analysts to save time, reduce errors, and scale insights — even before advanced analytics or machine learning.
